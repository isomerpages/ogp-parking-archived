## Ending your Parking Session

##### What happens if I forget to end my parking session?
If you do not extend your parking session, it will expire automatically after the initial specified parking duration.


##### What happens to my parking session when my phone runs out of battery?
The parking session will continue to run, and will expire at the end of the selected parking duration. You can choose to purchase another parking session from another mobile device if you wish to park for a longer duration or display parking coupons.


##### Does the app track my parking history?
Yes, you can view your parking history by accessing the parking history page found on the left side menu in the app. You will not be able to retrieve your parking history on your phone if you uninstall the app.


##### If the session expires automatically without extension, will this become a loophole for motorists to exploit to avoid paying parking charges?
The app has a notification feature that reminds users to renew their parking session if they wish to continue parking at the car park. If the parking session is not extended, motorists may be issued with a parking offence notice.


##### Why am I not receiving any sound notifications even though my phone is not in silent mode?
For sound notifications to work, please make sure that that you have enabled all permissions for Parking.sg in your phone settings. Other than that, we are aware that China branded smartphones like Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei has aggressive battery optimisation that may block the notifications. For users of China branded smartphones, add the app under the Protected Apps to resolve the notification issues.
