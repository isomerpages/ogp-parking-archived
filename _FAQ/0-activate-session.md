### Activating your Parking Session

##### How does Parking.sg App work?
Parking.sg allows you to pay short-term parking charges through your mobile device at all existing coupon-based public car parks. The app will serve as an alternative mode of payment to paper parking coupons. You will need to key in your vehicle number, select the car park, indicate the parking duration, pay using your credit or debit card and start parking. You will also be able to extend the parking session remotely via the app. You do not need to use the Parking.sg app for parking at car parks already installed with the Electronic Parking System (EPS).

 

##### When must I start the parking session?
You should start a parking session via the Parking.sg app once you park in a designated parking lot. Enforcement officers have been trained to identify digitally parked vehicles.

 

##### Why do I need to select a parking duration? Why canâ€™t the app just make use of a start/stop button?
You may forget to end your parking session. When that happens, your charges will continue to run. This can be avoided if motorists select an estimated duration at the start of a new session. If you end your parking session earlier, you will receive a refund on the remaining amount.

 

##### How do I select the correct car park?
You may refer to the car park code indicated on all existing car park signboards We have installed new signboards and also enhanced existing ones within car parks and along kerbside lots to increase the visibility of the car park code.

 

##### Why am I not able to locate car parks nearby? 
To locate car parks nearby, please make sure that you have turned on the location function in your phone setting.



##### Why is it necessary to have to select the car park I am parked in when I start a parking session?
Different car parks have different parking schemes. Selecting the correct car park will ensure that you are paying the correct rates.



##### What happens if I forget to bring my phone or if I have no network coverage?
If you are unable to park using the app for these reasons stated above, you will have to display parking coupons. Alternatively, you can consider parking your vehicle at nearby car parks that operate on the Electronic Parking System (EPS).



##### What happens if I key in my vehicle and parking details wrongly?
You can simply end the parking session and start a new one with the correct details.



##### Will I get fined if I key in my vehicle and parking details wrongly?
Yes, you may get a parking offence notice if you input wrong details for your parking session.



##### Can I start a parking session on behalf of another person?
Yes, you can. You will need to enter the correct vehicle and parking details on behalf of the other person to start a parking session. There can only be one session activated per app.



##### Am I entitled to a 10-minute grace period after I have parked via the app?
You will need to activate your parking session via the app after you have parked your vehicle. This differs from EPS, where a 10 minutes grace period is provided for motorists to locate a parking lot after entering the car park, to do a quick drop off or pick up passengers.



##### Can I start a parking session for multiple vehicles?
No, you will not be able to park for multiple vehicles using the app.



##### I own/drive multiple vehicles. Can the app allow me to save all my vehicles?
Yes, the app automatically saves your recently used vehicles based on your parking history.
