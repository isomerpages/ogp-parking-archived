##### I have a Class 1 disability label. Can the app give me the first hour free?
Yes, you can still enjoy your first hour of parking for free, which is no different from current practice. If you need to continue parking after the first hour, you will need to start a parking session using the app.

 

##### I am using the app and no longer require the use of coupons. Will I be able to return the coupons?
As parking coupons will continue to be in use, you have the option of using the Parking.sg app or your existing coupons to pay for parking. There is no need to return the parking coupons.

 

##### Are foreign vehicles allowed to park using the app?
Yes, all vehicles including foreign vehicles can park using the app.
