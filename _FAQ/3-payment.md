## Making Payment

##### Why am I receiving a SMS notification a few days after my parking sessions?
We are grouping multiple charges together, so that there will be fewer credit card charges reflected on your statement. With these changes, some users may receive an additional SMS notification from your banks about the final “grouped” charge a few days after the first parking session was made.

 

##### So how do I cross verify my parking sessions with my bank statement?
If you need to cross-verify your parking sessions with your bank statement, go to Parking History and click on each parking session, which will show you the status of the Bill ID.
 
Those sessions that are already grouped will have their own Bill ID, which you can cross reference with the Bill ID in your bank statement. Those that are yet to be grouped will be reflected as “PENDING”


##### Why am I getting billed for the entire parking duration which I originally selected even though I ended my session early?
The app initially charges you for the entire parking duration which you originally selected. When you end your session early, the app then refunds you the unused amount, calculated on a per-minute basis. If you do not see it reflected on your debit or credit card statement, please wait a while before checking again as it may still be in processing.



##### How do I pay for my parking sessions?
If this is the first time using the app, you will be prompted to enter your credit or debit card details before you proceed to confirm the parking session. Currently, only Visa, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards are accepted.

 

##### If I do not have any credit card, are there other alternatives?
Yes, you can try virtual credit cards such as but not limited to Singtel Dash, or any other payment providers. As of now, we have seen users using Singtel Dash for Parking.sg successfully. If you have found any successful use case of virtual credit cards, kindly contact us at feedback@parking.sg so we can update our FAQs. However, please take note that we do not accept any liability for any damage through the use of such virtual credit cards.


##### Is it safe to store my credit card details in the app?
Your credit card details are not stored in the app. When you first enter your credit card details in the app, the payment information is instead saved with our secure payment provider. This allows you to continue paying for your parking charges without having to enter your credit card details again. Your details are kept safe even if your phone is compromised. To cancel your payment information with our secure payment provider, you will only need to select ‘Remove Card’ from the left slide out menu.


##### Why is there no one-time password (OTP) activated for login since it involves monetary transactions?
As the app does not store users’ credit card information, to require a one-time password verification for every transaction will affect the user experience. Hence we have not included this function.
