      title: Calculate fees automatically
      description: >-
        Instead of displaying parking coupons, you can use the app to key in
        your vehicle number, select the car park and indicate your parking
        duration. The app will automatically calculate the charges you have to
        pay using your credit or debit card.

      title: Extend remotely
      description: >-
        The app allows you to track your parking session and receive
        notifications when it is expiring. You can extend your parking duration
        at your own time and convenience, without having to return to your
        vehicle to add more coupons.

        on a per minute basis will be given.
